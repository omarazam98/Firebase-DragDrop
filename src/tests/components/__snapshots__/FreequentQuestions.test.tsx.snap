  <SimpleAccordion
    body="Renting with Win-Win doesn’t mean you’ll be a caretaker responsible for the homeowner’s health and tasks related to their well-being. It simply means you’ll take on chores that will help them stay in their home for longer. You will select which chores you would like to do as part of the intake process.
TLDR: Not care-giving, but helping with care."

Win Win will help facilitate whatever is required whether it be to help housemates work through issues or to shorten the duration of the home share."

  <SimpleAccordion
    body="Our prices will always be a fraction of the costs of renting a room in the same area.
