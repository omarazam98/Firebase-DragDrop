  {
    question: 'What are the responsibilities?',
    answer: 'Renting with Win-Win doesn’t mean you’ll be a caretaker responsible ' +
      'for the homeowner’s health and tasks related to their well-being. It simply ' +
      'means you’ll take on chores that will help them stay in their home for longer. ' +
      'You will select which chores you would like to do as part of the intake process.' +
      '\nTLDR: Not care-giving, but helping with care.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if I don’t get along with my seniors?',
    answer: 'Finding a roommate to get along with can be difficult, but our matching ' +
      'service differentiates us from other rental options. We are dedicated to working on a' +
      ' match that fits both parties, but sometimes not all matches are made in heaven. Each' +
      ' issue will be dealt on a case-by-case basis. Win Win will help facilitate whatever ' +
      'is required whether it be to help housemates work through issues or to shorten the ' +
      'duration of the home share.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What about exams?',
    answer: 'Studying is demanding and can affect your ability to fulfill assigned duties. ' +
      'If your exam schedule is too demanding to upkeep with your chores, update the app and ' +
      'adjust the tasks list for the time you’ll be unavailable. Not upkeeping your chores ' +
      'with communication will result in fees, so make sure you’re clear on your ability to ' +
      'upkeep your chores.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Am I liable for the health and well-being of the senior?',
    answer: 'Home-sharing is not care-giving. Students are only expected to keep up with the ' +
      'agreed-upon chores and companionship, not for the ongoing care of the seniors they are ' +
      'living with.\nTLDR: No.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Am I being paid?',
    answer: 'Although you aren’t being paid an hourly wage, you are being rewarded for your ' +
      'help with significantly discounted rent. That means fewer hours working a part-time ' +
      'job to focus on studies, friends, and enjoying your time at school.\nTLDR: No, but your ' +
      'rent is subsidized.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need a vehicle?',
    answer: 'No, you do not need a vehicle.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How many chores/hours a week?',
    answer: 'This depends on how many you have agreed upon completing. The average is 8-10 ' +
      'hours of help around the house a month.\nTLDR: You choose how much work you’d like to ' +
      'commit to.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does the matching work?',
    answer: 'Your safety matters. We ensure background checks on all homeowners and renters. ' +
      'We also match you with ideal candidates best suited for both your home and lifestyle. ' +
      'Our matching process is based on common values, desired chores, interests, hobbies, ' +
      'and habits.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does it cost me for rent?',
    answer: 'Our prices will always be a fraction of the costs of renting a room in the ' +
      'same area. Our prices are based on the location, the furnishings provided, the quality ' +
      'of the home, and other factors. On top of that, the price is tied into the number of ' +
      'chores you are willing to take on, so if you’re looking for really cheap rent, ' +
      'consider staying open to providing more help around the house.\nTLDR: it’s cheap– but ' +
      'how cheap is up to you.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I pay rent?',
    answer: 'Paying rent is easy with Win-Win. Through our system, we ensure homeowners' +
      ' are getting paid by taking payments from the renters. This allows us to track what ' +
      'has been paid/when, and that there is no delay in payment.\nSimply sign in and to ' +
      'check your balances, or set up recurring payments.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I’m not home every night?',
    answer: 'Busy schedules are a trademark of university life, but making time to attend ' +
      'to chores is necessary and part of a written agreement. Having an open conversation ' +
      'about your schedule and time at home is common courtesy for home-sharing.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I get a discount if I’m a medical student?',
    answer: 'Although you do not receive discounts for being any kind of student, placing ' +
      'your education on your profile will be a great way to introduce yourself to potential ' +
      'homesharers. Also in certain fields doing this program will be a great way to gain ' +
      'and show your experience working in the field of care.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What will I be responsible for?',
    answer: 'You are responsible for the chores you have agreed to do on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. The more chores you agree to help with, the cheaper your rent will be.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long can I rent for?',
    answer: 'As long as you are a student, you may rent with Win-Win Homesharing. The shortest rentals available are two-months long, although popular leases span between 4, 8, or 12 month periods. All contracts are extendable for as long as both parties are satisfied and want to continue.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What’s the living space like?',
    answer: 'Rooms are furnished and displayed on our platform. Each home is different, so be sure to connect with the senior beforehand to find out more. Sign up and explore today!',
  },
  {
    question: 'What about pets?',
    answer: 'Pets are allowed, but both parties must be notified and willing to live beforehand. Who wouldn’t want to walk a dog for discounted rent? Be sure to list allergies on your profile, if any.',
