## What is the store?
The redux store is where client side state is ...well stored. 
The store can be modified through reducers.
And portions of the store can be mapped to the props of components

## What goes in the store folder
The only file needed in the store folder is the createStore file.
This is used to declare the reducers that are included, and the overall structure, as well as middleware (thunk).
